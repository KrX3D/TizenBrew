# TizenBrew

Welcome to TizenBrew! TizenBrew is a way to experience modded websites (like [TizenTube](https://github.com/reisxd/TizenTube)) and you can install newer apps without having to deal with Tizen Studio multiple times.

TizenBrew is a modular system, meaning you can install new modded websites and apps without having to mess with Tizen Studio.

## Installation

To install TizenBrew, you need to have a Samsung TV (Tizen) device that has at least Tizen 3.0 (2017 or newer). There are four ways to install TizenBrew.

### PREFERRED: Using TizenBrew Installer

This is the easiest method and works on every Samsung TV released since 2017.

#### 1. Set the Host PC IP Address to your PCs IP
1. Open **Apps** or **App Settings** on your Samsung TV.
2. In the **Apps** panel, enter `12345` using your remote control or the on-screen keypad.
3. A *Developer Mode* configuration popup will appear:
   - Switch **Developer mode** to **On**.
   - Under **Host PC IP**, enter your PCs IP.
4. Click **OK**.
5. Reboot your TV.

For more details, see [Step 1 here under “Connecting the TV and SDK”](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/getting-started/using-sdk/tv-device.html#Connecting-the-TV-and-SDK).

#### 2. Download and run TizenBrew Installer Desktop on your PC
1. Download the [latest executable file for your OS](https://github.com/reisxd/TizenBrewInstaller/releases/latest) from the TizenBrewInstaller repository.

If you're on macOS or Linux, you may need to run the file from the terminal and may need to run `chmod +x tizenbrew-installer-os-arch`

#### 3. Install TizenBrew
1. Click **Install TizenBrew** to install TizenBrew.

> **Note:** If you're on **Tizen 7 or above**, you’ll be prompted to sign in to your Samsung account. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a Samsung certificate.

> Did you know that you can install other apps (such as Jellyfin, Moonlight, etc.) from TizenBrew Installer? All you need is either the GitHub repository (in the format of `user/repo` or WGT/TPK file (TV version of TizenBrew Installer only, you can install it from TizenBrew Installer Desktop.)

2. Install the resigned TizenBrew by running:
```bash
tizen install -n ./resigned/TizenBrewStandalone.wgt
```

3. Set the Host PC IP address to `127.0.0.1` by following [this](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/getting-started/using-sdk/tv-device.html#Connecting-the-TV-and-SDK)

## Rebuilding TizenBrew

To rebuild TizenBrew, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/). You also need to have Tizen Studio installed on your system. You can install Tizen Studio from [here](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/getting-started/setting-up-sdk/installing-tv-sdk.html).

1. Download the source code from the [releases page](https://github.com/reisxd/TizenBrew/releases/latest) (zip file) or clone the repository by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/reisxd/TizenBrew.git
```

2. Open up the `tizenbrew-app/TizenBrew/service-nextgen/service` folder in a terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
npx @vercel/ncc build index.js
```

3. Open up the `tizenbrew-app/TizenBrew/tizenbrew-ui` folder in a terminal and run:

```bash
npm install --force
npm run build
```

4. Open up Certificate Manager by going to `Tools > Certificate Manager` and create a new Samsung certificate. See [this](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/getting-started/setting-up-sdk/creating-certificates.html) for more information.

5. Change the Host PC IP address to your PCs IP by following [this](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/getting-started/using-sdk/tv-device.html#Connecting-the-TV-and-SDK)

6. Open up the `tizenbrew-app/TizenBrew` folder in a terminal and run:

```bash
sdb connect <TV IP>
tizen build-web -e ".*" -e "node_modules/*" -e "package*.json" -e "yarn.lock"
tizen package -t wgt -o ./release -- .buildResult
tizen install -n ./release/TizenBrewStandalone.wgt
```

Note that tizen is in `C:\tizen-studio\tools\ide\bin` on Windows and in `~/tizen-studio/tools/ide/bin` on Linux. Add it to your PATH or run it using `C:\tizen-studio\tools\ide\bin\tizen` on Windows and `~/tizen-studio/tools/ide/bin/tizen` on Linux. sdb is in `C:\tizen-studio\tools` on Windows and in `~/tizen-studio/tools` on Linux. Do the same for sdb as you did for tizen.

7. Change the Host PC IP address to `127.0.0.1` by following [this](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/getting-started/using-sdk/tv-device.html#Connecting-the-TV-and-SDK)

8. You can now launch the TizenBrew app on your TV.

## Developer Mode IP and Logging (SDB)

If you keep **Host PC IP** set to `127.0.0.1`, TV-side developer tools are bound to localhost behavior. This is what TizenBrew needs, but it blocks normal remote `sdb connect <TV IP>` from a different machine.

### Does SDB support custom ports?

Yes, SDB can target `ip:port` (for example `sdb connect 192.168.1.20:26101`).

However, in this setup the main blocker is the TV Developer Mode Host PC IP policy. If Host PC IP is fixed to `127.0.0.1`, remote SDB sessions from your PC are still typically not accepted even if you try another port.

### If you still need SDB logs on your PC

1. Change Host PC IP to your PC LAN IP.
2. Reboot TV.
3. Run `sdb connect <TV IP>:26101` (or your configured port).
4. Collect logs (`sdb dlog`, etc.).
5. Switch Host PC IP back to `127.0.0.1` and reboot.
